\begin{frame}{What is R?}

\begin{itemize}
    \item R is an open-source \textbf{interpreted} programming language: when you install R, you install an \textit{interpreter} that translates your R code into computer code (sometimes called ``machine'' code), which is what actually gets run
    \item This is in contrast to \textbf{compiled} languages (e.g. C or C++), where the programmer writes code that is directly converted into machine code
    \item Several advantages of interpreted languages: much more user friendly, easily read, consistent across operating systems
    \item Some disadvantages: often slower, and less control over system hardware$^*$
\end{itemize}

\vspace{1em}

\bmagenta{Action step:} Install R (https://cloud.r-project.org/)

\begin{frame}{R Studio: Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item We can interact with R directly via a command line (e.g. Terminal)
    \begin{figure}[tb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = .35\textwidth]{R-terminal.png}
    \end{figure}
    \item But this is not very pretty or reproducible! A population alternative is to use an IDE, such as R Studio, which is a program that adds a whole lot of convenience to writing and running R code
    \item IDEs are not the language themselves, they provide a way to interact with the language installed on your computer in a friendly way
\end{itemize}

\bmagenta{Action step:} Install R Studio (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

Key R Studio panes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Console: Runs R code, either interactively or via an R script
    \item Terminal: Convenient terminal application (primarily useful for version control programs like git/GitHub)
    \item Environment: Objects you've saved to your \textbf{working R environment}
    \item Files: File navigator, useful if you need to figure out where data/R scripts are located
    \item Plots: Plots generated will populate in this pane -- you can also export plots you create using the ``Export'' button
