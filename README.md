# PHS-Launch

This repository contains the files for the Population Health Science [Launch website](https://phslaunch.netlify.app), a workshop held at the end of the summer for Harvard University Population Health Sciences PhD students. 

Files were produced using the `blogdown` package in RStudio, and deployed continuously to Netflify.
